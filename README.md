Lcobucci\EasySoap
=================

PHP library to create SOAP webservices

**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED**

Installation
------------

Type the following commands in your terminal:

  * `pear channel-discover lcobucci.github.com`
  * `pear install lcobucci/EasySoap-alpha`

Make sure that PEAR is in your include_path.

Important
---------

 * EasySoap and Annotation follows PSR-0 conventions, so make sure to use a compatible autoloader.
 * The WSDL will be generated on RPC/Literal binding style

Configuration
-------------

The first step you have to do is to configure the annotation's cache path of your project:

    (boot.php)
    <?php
    // Register your autoloader here
        
    use \Mindplay\Annotation\Core\Annotations;
    use \Mindplay\Annotation\Cache\ApcCache;
    
    Annotations::$config['cache'] = new ApcCache(); // Make sure you have APC (you can use FileCache instead)
    
Basic Usage
-----------

To create a webservice you must create a PHP class (with namespace or not) that uses the **WebService** annotation, like this example:

    (Lcobucci/Tools/Service/Calculator.php)
    <?php
    namespace Lcobucci\Tools\Services;
    
    /**
     * @WebService
     */
    class Calculator
    {
    }
    
And set at least one method to be exposed with the **WebServiceMethod** annotation:

    (Lcobucci/Tools/Services/Calculator.php)
    <?php
    namespace Lcobucci\Tools\Services;
    
    /**
     * @WebService
     */
    class Calculator
    {
        /**
         * Returns the sum of given numbers
         *
         * @param number $num1
         * @param number $num2
         * @return number
         * @WebServiceMethod
         */
        public function sum($num1, $num2)
        {
            return $num1 + $num2;
        }
    }
    
After that you just have to instantiate Lcobucci\EasySoap\Core\SoapServer and call the handle() method:

    (index.php)
    <?php
    require 'boot.php'; // File with the autoloader and annotations cache path
    
    use Lcobucci\EasySoap\Core\SoapServer;
    
    $server = new SoapServer();
    $server->handle('Lcobucci\Tools\Services\Calculator'); // Always the full name of the class

And thats all, just access the index.php and you'll see a little documentation about your webservice.
If you want to see the WSDL document, access index.php?wsdl

Pretty easy, right?

Going deeper
-----------

What more can you do? Well look:

 * Complex types: just use the FULL class name on **@var**, **@param** or **@return** annotation
 * Arrays: You can use arrays just appending **[]** on the end of the type of **@var** annotation (arrays must always be inside of a complex type)
 * WebService annotation: you can set the **XML namespace**, the **service name** and the **service endpoint** on the WebService annotation - @Webservice('name'=>'SuperCalculator')
 * WebServiceMethod annotation: you can override @param and @return types on the WebServiceMethod annotation - @WebServiceMethod('return'=>'datetime')
 * WebServiceProperty annotation: you can override @var type using the optional WebServiceProperty annotation (on the complex types) - @WebServiceAnnotation('type'=>'date')
 
Roadmap
-------

 * Have complex type from different namespaces
 * Create tests
 * Use XSD complex type inheritance when it's needed
